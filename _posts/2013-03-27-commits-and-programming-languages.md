[Donnie Berkholz's blog
post](http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/)
on the expressiveness of programming languages has generated quite some online
buzz. In this post, Donnie used the Ohloh dataset to rank programming languages
by their expressiveness, as it can be approximated by the number of lines per
commit in projects written in this language. The details of what data did the
author process are not provided, xor a [minor comment](http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/#comment-843196282) by the author as a response to another comment.

In our paper {% cite_details GS12, GHTorrent: GitHubâ€™s Data from a Firehose %}, [Diomidis](http://www.spinellis.gr) and I had included 
a similar plot (even though for different reasons). To do it, we used data
from the [GHTorrent](http://www.ghtorrent.org) projects, namely around 8.5
million commits. For each commit, we extracted the number of lines for 
*changed* files; that is, we did not account for files being introduced to or
being removed from the project. We did the matching of lines changed to
language used on a per file basis, by guessing the language by the file
extension). The results can be seen in the following figure:

I will be careful not to make any remarks regarding the expressiveness of
programming languages based on this data. The data speaks for itself and
contradicts many observations Donnie included in his blog. I do believe
however that the method used to extract the data is more sound as:

 * The effect of copying-pasting code, common in environments such as Javascript
 where developers include whole libraries to their repository, to the results
 is non-existent as such actions are discarded.
 
 * By relying on file extension matching to identify the programming language
 we get far more accurate results per language than relying on Github's or
 Ohloh's project language identification.
