On Sep 26 2013, I participated at the ICSM 2013 panel on open access. I gave a
presentation and then we discussed with 
[Gregorio Robles](http://gsyc.urjc.es/~grex/) and 
[Mike Goodfrey](http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~migod/)
(and of course with the audience) about the challenges of open access research.

My presentation was entitled "A tale of two datasets" and it was about the
lessons I 've learned by building two large software engineering research data
sets, namely [SQO-OSS](http://www.sqo-oss.org) and
[GHTorrent](http://ghtorrent.org). Specifically, I attributed the relative lack
of external users in the first case and the ever increasing number of users in
the second case to
the different approaches the two projects followed with respect to open access.

The main points I tried to raise during my presentation, based on what
I 've learned from build SQO-OSS and GHTorrent, where the following:

* *Aim for lean and mean*:
When building an open access research tool or dataset, we should
offer the minimum viable product. The least possible
piece of functionality that makes sense and lets people create by building on
top of it. This can be data plus good documentation or a tool that does one
thing very well, again with good documentation. 

* *Infrastructures and platforms are overrated*: The effort required to learn
how the infrastructure works before actually exploiting them scientifically
should not be overlooked. The invested effort must return gains and concequently
big effort calls for big gains. There is always the risk of deprecation.
Especially in the field of software engineering, where new developments are
happening every day, the risk of deprecation is very high. In my opinion, this
is why many people in research keep re-inventing the wheel and do not reuse.

* *Open now trumps open when it’s done*: Most
importantly, no one is going to wait for us to perfect what we‘re doing.  The
only thing that we risk if we open up our research early enough is for our
research to be ignored: then again, this is a sign that we should change
direction. If we open up early, and our work is interesting enough, "enough
eyeballs" will catch our mistakes early on and propose corrections to make our
research even more interesting. Open access is an absolute must for adoption
and widespreading of research and research results. This should happen as early
as possible.
