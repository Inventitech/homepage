### Online Profile

I try to maintain a number of online profiles. When I can, I do connect
them and allow the one to update the other. Unfortunately, it seems
that with today's information hungry online services it is hard to
maintain a low profile if you want to stay relevant. Here is a list of
services that host (some version of) my online profile
