Since Mar 11, 2009, I am officially in thesis writing mode. The plan
is to have the thesis writen by end June 2009. I usually find peer
pressure to be very effective for keeping me motivated when I
work on not too engaging stuff. I 've put together
this page to monitor my progress towards the tight deadline.

Feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:gousiosg@gmail.com) to encourage my progress or critisize the lack of it!

*Update Jul 2009: I 've succesfully defended my PhD thesis. The
Thesis-o-meter is over!*

The thesis-o-meter is not
[not](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~wouter/thesisometer.html)
my invention;

[other](http://www.damas.ift.ulaval.ca/~jlaumoni/thesisometer.php4?lang=en)
[researchers](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jsinger/phd.html)
have tried this before and
[this letter](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~akw27/thesisometer-explained.txt)
explains why and how the Thesis-o-meter works.
However, my  Thesis-o-meter was the first to use the Google Chart API instead of `gnuplot` to draw the plots. I guess I can call it the  first Web 2.0 Thesis-o-meter :-)

To make it work on your page, feel free to copy the tom.js script included
in this page.
