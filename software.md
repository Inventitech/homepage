### Projects

* *GHTorrent* is a collection of tools to mirror data from Github's [v3 API](http://developer.github.com) for
research purposes (see {% cite_details GS12 --text relevant publication %}). The project is currently being
[developed](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror) while some initial data
[has been released](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror/wiki/Available-Torrents). Expect several gigabytes of dumps in the comming months!

* In our work {% cite_details GS13 --text Conducting Quantitative Software Engineering Studies with Alitheia Core %}, we used both the Alitheia Core dataset and a new, sorter dataset. Find
more details on how to replicate the case studies reported in this paper [here](/research/qsesac.html).

* *Alitheia Core* is a platform that enables researchers in the field of software
engineering to automate experiments and distribute the processing load on a
cluster of machines. I maintain the project in its own site. The project has
been the centerpiece of my [PhD work](phd.html), while it has been presented
individually in {% cite_details GS09a --text this work %}. A dump of the Alitheia Core
database as it was by the end of my PhD can be found from [this page](phd.html).
The data schema has changed a lot since then so if you are interested in a
recent version of those, please contact me directly.

* The *Java DTrace Toolkit (JDT)* is a series of Perl scripts that use the JVM DTrace providers on <del>Open</del>Solaris to provide deep insights on how Java software executes and how it interacts with the operating system. [More...](/sw/jdt.html)

### Scripts and Hacks

* *Whereami* is a Perl script along with a J2ME application that allows a user to
record his tracks and allows other users to view the current status, speed and
altitude of the data sharing user on a Google map. This hack was done back on
Dec 07, long before Google released its similarly functioning, but widely more
popular, Latitude service. You can find it here .

* *Thesis-o-meter*: Almost all computer science PhD students implement a tool to
monitor their thesis writing progress some time. I am [sharing mine here](/sw/tom.html) to help against re-inventing the wheel (even though I am pretty sure this particular wheel will keep being re-invented forever --- procrastination is much more enjoyable than writing).

### Github

Lately, I have been using Github for most of my development work. You can find my profile [here](https://github.com/gousiosg).
