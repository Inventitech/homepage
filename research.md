##Interests

I am genuinely interested in any topic that has to do with systems, software and security, and combinations thereof. Specifically my research interests are
the following:

* Software engineering
* Software analytics
* Programming languages
* Systems software

###Software Engineering - Software Analytics

#### Current work

I am currently exploring how
{% cite_details GPD14 --text pull-based distributed software development %} works both [quantitatively](https://github.com/gousiosg/pullreqs)
({%cite_details GPD14 --text ICSE 2014 %}) and
[qualitatively](https://github.com/gousiosg/pullreqs-survey)
({%cite_details GZSD15 --text ICSE 2015 %},
{%cite_details GSB16 --text ICSE 2016 %}).
{% cite_details GZ14 --text The dataset %} I developed as part of the
quantitative investigation, won the [best dataset award](http://2014.msrconf.org/history.php) at MSR 2014. Using the findings of the qualitative work, I have
also co-proposed a service to help developers
{% cite_details VGZ15 --text prioritize pull request handling %} and a service to {% cite_details HG15 --text match job advertisments to developer profiles %}.

I actively develop and maintain a
[collection of tools](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror) for
{% cite_details GS12 --text obtaining %}
and {% cite_details G13 --text analysing %} data from Github, throught the [GHTorrent](https://ghtorrent.org) project. The project has been awarded
the [best data project award](http://2014.msrconf.org/history.php) at MSR 2013
and has been selected as the official dataset of the
[MSR 2014 mining challenge](http://2014.msrconf.org/challenge.php).
At the moment (Feb 2016)
[80 papers](https://scholar.google.gr/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&cites=11132126230347149781)
[where based on it](http://ghtorrent.org/halloffame.html), more that 100 researchers are [using its data](http://ghtorrent.org/raw.html),
while GitHub included it in its
[2014 data challenge](https://github.com/blog/1864-third-annual-github-data-challenge).
Together with collegues, we have documented the promises and pitfalls of doing research with GHTorrent
({% cite_details KGBSGD14 --text MSR14 %},
{% cite_details KGBSGD15 --text EMSE %}).

On a parallel track, I am also doing research, in the context of the
[TestRoots](http://testroots.org) project on how developers use automated
testing. In this context, I co-implemented a data collection and analysis
pipeline for the [Watchdog](https://github.com/TestRoots/watchdog) framework
and co-implemented a similar pipeline for [Travis CI data](https://github.com/Inventitech/travis-analysis). With those tools, we have shown
({% cite_details BGZ15 --text ICSE-NIER15%},
{% cite_details BGPZ15 --text FSE15 %}) that developers
do not test as much as they thing they do, do not follow TDD approaches and
investigated how testing in done in CI (submission to FSE 2016).

#### Past work
I led the design and development of [Alitheia Core](http://www.sqo-oss.org)
(also on [Github](https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core)), a
{% cite_details GS14 --text high performance software analytics platform %}
that works with data from software repositories. I used the platform to develop models for the {% cite_details KGSP09 --text evaluation %} of
{% cite_details GKS08 --text developer contribution %}, to investigate the evolution of {% cite_details MGS12 --text software security issues %} and to
{% cite_details Gousi09-phdthesis --text process %}
and [share](http://demo.sqo-oss.org) data from more than
[700 open source software repositories](http://ikaria.dmst.aueb.gr/repositories/).

I also proposed a
{% cite_details GKAG06B --text platform %} for
{% cite_details SGKLASS09 --text analysing the quality of OSS projects %} and a
corresponding
{% cite_details SGSS08 --text hierarchical metrics-based software quality model %} for evaluating both the
process and the product quality. I have contributed to a
{% cite_details ASKG11 --text comprehensive survey %} of the literature in OSS research.

###Systems Software and Security

I {% cite_details Gousi04-mscthesis --text ported %} [JikesRVM](http://jikesrvm.org),
a JVM written mostly in Java, to run on top of bare hardware, without support
from an operating system. Later, I contributed patches to the JikesRVM project
to enable support for Opensolaris, and in the context of the [Google Summer of
Code 2008](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/jikesrvm/about.html) program, to
compile and [run with OpenJDK](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/RVM/Acknowledgments). I also proposed
an architecture to make Javaâ€™s I/O subsystem faster by
{% cite_details G07 --text replacing the operating system with a hypervisor %}
and thus relieving it of
context switches and unnecessary data copies; an almost identical approach has
been independently developed into the JRockit virtual edition product.

On the systems performance front, I have studied the performance of then popular
dynamic content generation technologies for the Apache web server
({% cite_details GS02 --text my first paper %}, which received a best paper award) and I
investigated ways for {% cite_details GKS06 --text optimally configuring %} the
garbage collection algorithms for the then two prevailing implementations of the
JVM. I have also {% cite_details GS08 --text implemented a library %}
that parses the output from the DTrace
provider for Java in order to reveal obscure problems in the co-operation of the
JVM with the operating system.

On the software security front, I co-developed a mechanism for identifying and
preventing cross-site scripting attacks through {% cite_details MSGS11 --text Javascript fingerprinting %},
I investigated the
{% cite_details MGS12 --text evolution of software security issues %}, an effort which
was then scaled to analyze the {% cite_details MKLGS13 --text entire Maven repository %}, and I analysed
the {% cite_details GAG04 --text security challenges and requirements %}
of (then) popular component software middleware.

##Projects

A list of research projects I have been actively involved with, along with a description of my role in them, in reverse chronological order:

[Testroots](http://testroots.org)
: The project investigates how developers use testing. The ultimate goal is to
learn from past behaviours to drive up testing quality and efficiency.

[Passive](http://ict-passive.eu/)
: The project investigated trust establishment frameworks in cloud computing and shared virtual machines environments. As part of the project management team, I oversaw and contributed to the mechanism design and software development.

[SQO-OSS](http://www.sqo-oss.org)
: The project developed a novel platform for software quality assessment. I was in charge of preparing the proposal, submitted it to the European Commission and handle the subsequent negotiations. As the project's manager, I oversaw its development. As member of the RTD team, I was the platform's chief designer and contributed the largest number of lines in its code base. After the end of the project, I maintain and expand its source code base. The project was the basis for my doctoral dissertation

[PENED](http://istlab.dmst.aueb.gr/content/projects/p_pened_b2b.html)
: The PENED series of projects were Greek state funded joint research projects for PhD students. Along with Stephanos Androutsellis Theotokis and Kostas Stroggylos, we investigated novel ways for doing secure business to business transactions, both at the architectural and at the implementation level. As a researcher, I oversaw the architectural design and optimised the developed platform.

[PRAXIS](http://istlab.dmst.aueb.gr/content/projects/p_praxis.html)
: The PRAXIS project looked into methods for performing automated document exchange in business to business and business to state scenarios. As a research assistant, I designed document schemas and a couple of exchange processes.

[Jamaica](http://apt.cs.man.ac.uk/projects/jamaica/)
: The project investigated chip multiprocessors and the accompanying parallel software. As part of my MSc research, I ported the JikesRVM Java virtual machine to run on top of bare hardware.
