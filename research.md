##Interests

I am genuinely interested in any topic that has to do with systems, software and security, and combinations thereof. Specifically my research interests are
the following:

* Software Engineering
* Programming languages
* Systems Software and security

###Software Engineering

I lead the design and development of [Alitheia Core](http://www.sqo-oss.org)
(also on [Github](https://github.com/istlab/Alitheia-Core)),
a high performance research platform that works with data from software repositories. I used the platform to develop models for the evaluation of developer contribution [7], to investigate the evolution of software security is- sues [15] and to process and share data from more than 600 open source software repositories [5].



###Systems Software and Security

##Projects
