title: Functional programming techniques in practice
---

During the last few years, we are witnessing a slight but noticeable shift
towards functional programming. Scripting languages, notably Python and Ruby,
pioneered the introduction of functional concepts, such as list comprehensions
and lambda functions, to mainstream programming. A new wave of programming
languages, developed to overcome the expressiveness and complexity limitations
exhibited in mainstream languages, have promoted functional constructs, such as
type safe pattern matching, higher order functions and immutable variables, to
first class citizens (Scala, C#). New, purely functional, languages have emerged
to fill in the remaining gaps (F#), often introducing significant advancements
in their field of specialisation (Erlang).

However, as functional programming has not caught mainstream attention yet, even
though it does make an appearance in specialised fields such as financial
engineering, it has been living below the radar of software engineers. Very
little research, if any, has been carried out on how software is written with
the functional paradigm. The consensus is that functionally enabled languages
allow experienced developers to express algorithms more intuitively and result
in significantly more concise and maintainable code.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a large scale empirical study on the
extend of use of functional programming constructs in mixed programming
languages. This study will attempt to answer the following questions:

* What functional programming constructs are most used by programmers? How
is the use distributed per language.

* Why do programmers choose to use functional code over OO or
  procedural code?

* Can we identify re-usable patterns of mixed OO/functional constuct use?
