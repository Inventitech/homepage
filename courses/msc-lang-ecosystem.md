title: Programming language ecosystem evolution
---

Software ecosystems are large collections of software packages that depend on
each other and co-evolve. Examples include the Java Maven repository, the Ruby
Gem repository and SqueakSource. However, one might consider that software
ecosystems are formed implicitly through the sharing of resources; when a
developer contributes to more that one repositories of the same language, he is
effectively creating a dependency link between those projects. The link is the
participation to the project's team.

The purpose of this work is:

* To conduct a large scale evolutionary analysis for language ecosystems,
including visualization

* To identify key moments in an ecosystem's lifetime, through visualization
or using automated means

* To assess through a survival analysis what would happen if key projects
in the ecosystem were abandoned
