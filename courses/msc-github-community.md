title: Community analysis for Github projects
---

During the last few years, GitHub has emerged as a popular project hosting, mirroring and collaboration platform. GitHub provides an extensive Rest API, which enables researchers to retrieve both the commits to the projectsâ€™ repositories and events generated through user actions on project resources. The [GHTorrent project](https://github.com/gousiosg/github-mirror) created an infrastructure to collect and process Github's event stream and all data linked from it. The purpose of this project is to perform socio-technical analysis on the data provided from Github. Ideas include:

* *Project communities*: How are project ecosystems being formed? How do they evolve?

* *Followers and Watchers*: Under what circumstances do project watchers become project members? Do pull requests help in team formation?

* *Socio-technical congruence*: Does team congruence translate to better software quality?
