I was teaching assistant for the TU Delft course on [reactive programming](serg url). The course
was an introduction to reactive programming and covered the Rx toolkit
(in combination with LINQ). The students then took on very challenging
projects to develop Rx providers for multiple systems (e.g. Loggly, the Java
Debugger Interface)

For this course, I organized 3 development sprints and guided students
through the executions of their projects.
