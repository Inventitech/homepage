title: Improving pull request handling on Github
---

During the last few years, GitHub has emerged as a popular project hosting,
mirroring and collaboration platform. A unique characteristic of Github is
the way it facilitates and automates the submission of patches through
forks and pull requests. Different projects employ different processes to
accept and analyze pull requests, which leads to very different patterns of
pull request usage. {% cite_details GPD14, Recent research %} has identified
several weakness on how pull requests are being handled by projects.

The purpose of this project is to develop with tools that will help
developers evaluate, prioritize and apply pull requests, based on 
machine learning and automatic content classification algorithms.
